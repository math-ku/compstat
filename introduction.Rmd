# Programming in R

---

## Prerequisite R Knowledge

We expect knowledge of

* data structures (vectors, lists, data frames),
--

* control structures (loops, if-then-else),
--

* function calling,
--

* interactive and script usage (`source`) of R.
--


All of this is covered in chapters 1â€“5 of [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/).

But you **do not** need to be an experienced programmer.


---
## Warm-Up Quiz

### Exercise 1

Can you list three ways to access element `a` in this list?

```{r}
l <- list(a = 1, b = 2)
```
```{r, include=FALSE}
l[[1]]
l$a
l[["a"]]
```

--

### Exercise 2

For a numerical vector `x` , write code to compute a vector
`y` of logicals such that `y[i]` is `TRUE` whenever `x[i] > 0`.

--

### Exercise 3

Write a for loop that prints "even" if the loop variable is even,
"odd" if the loop variable is odd, and exits if is
larger than 10.

# Functions

---
## Functions in R

- Everything that happens in R is the result of a function call. Even `+`, `[` and `<-` are functions.
--

- An R function takes a number of *arguments*, and when a function call is evaluated it computes a *return value*.
--

- Functions can return any R object, including functions!
--

- Implementations of R functions are collected into source files, which can be organized into packages.
--

- The order of your functions in the script does not matter.
--

---

## Components of a Function

```{r}
f <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

--

.pull-left[

### Arguments

```{r}
formals(f)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
### Body

```{r}
body(f)
```

### Environment

```{r}
environment(f)
```
]

--- 

## Naming Functions

### Use descriptive names

- Verbs are great.
- Better long and descriptive than short and cryptic.

--

### Naming Convetions

- Avoid `.` in names; it is used for **methods** (upcoming).
- Use consistent style: 
  * `lowercase`
  * `snake_case` (tidyverse)
  * `camelCase`
  * `UpperCamelCase`

--

### Namespace Clashes

- Avoid names of existing functions.

---

## Example: Counting Zeros

Count data is often modeled using a Poisson 
distribution. R can simulate count data using the function `rpois()`.

```{r, echo=2}
set.seed(1234)
rpois(10, 2) # n = 10 variables from a Poisson(2) distribution
```

--

There are two zeros in this sequence.

--

Let's write a function that counts the number of zeros: checks
for zero inflation.

---
## A First Attempt

```{r}
count_zeros <- function(x) {
  n_zeros <- 0
  for (i in 1:length(x)) {
    if (x[i] == 0) {
      n_zeros <- n_zeros + 1
    }
  }
  n_zeros
}

count_zeros(c(3, 2, 0))
```

--

```{r}
count_zeros(c(0, 0, 0))
```

---
## Testing

- Tests that a given input to a function returns
  what you expect.
--

- Thumb of rule: when you find a bug in your function, write a test
  that fails on it; *then* fix the function.
--

- As you refactor your code (or dependent code changes), your
  tests will catch these **regressions** for you.
--

- Some people even say that writing tests is the first thing you
  should do.
--

- In R, most common solution is to use the **testthat** package.
--

- Works best in packages, but is fine for projects too.


---

## Testing with **testthat**

```{r unit-testing, eval = FALSE, error = TRUE}
# In file tests/test_count_zeros.R
test_that("count_zeros work on various input", {
  expect_equal(count_zeros(c(0, 0, 1e-9, 25)), 2)
  expect_equal(count_zeros(c(-0, 1.1, -2)), 1)
  expect_equal(count_zeros(c()), 0)
})
```

---

```{r testthat, error = TRUE}
testthat::test_dir("tests")
```

---
## A Second Attempt

```{r}
count_zeros <- function(x) {
  n_zeros <- 0
  for (i in seq_along(x)) { #<<
    if (x[i] == 0) {
      n_zeros <- n_zeros + 1
    }
  }
  n_zeros
}
```
```{r}
testthat::test_dir("tests")
```
---

## Debugging

- Sometimes hard to identify the offending piece of code.
--

- Helpful to use a debugging tool. R studio comes with a helpful interface for this.
--

- We will talk more about debugging in week 5.

---
## Functional Programming

We have already used `sapply()` with a function as its second argument.

--

It is a feature of R as a functional programming language that it can operate with
functions as with any other data structure.

--

Let's write our own apply function.

```{r own-apply}
our_apply <- function(x, fun) {
  val <- numeric(length(x)) # initialize vector of return values
  for (i in seq_along(x)) {
    val[i] <- fun(x[[i]])
  }
  val
}
```

---
## Testing Our Apply Function

```{r}
sapply(1:10, exp)
our_apply(1:10, exp)
```

--

### Assumptions

`x` is a list, `fun()` takes a single
argument, and `fun()` returns a numeric.

---
## What if `fun()` Needs Additional Arguments?

```{r, error=TRUE, echo=-1}
set.seed(1)
our_apply(1:10, rpois)
```

--

### Anonymous Functions

```{r}
our_apply(
  1:10,
  function(lambda) rpois(1, lambda = 0.9) #<<
)
```

---
## `...`

The `...` (ellipsis) argument passes arguments forward.

```{r own-apply-2}
our_apply <- function(x, fun, ...) {
  val <- numeric(length(x))
  for (i in seq_along(x)) {
    val[i] <- fun(x[[i]], ...)
  }
  val
}
```

--

```{r}
our_apply(1:10, rpois, n = 1)
```

# Benchmarking

---

## R Is Slow ... 

... when used like a low-level language.

--
- R is an **interpreted** (as opposed to *compiled*) language.

--
- It was written mainly for specifying statistical models (not for
  developing new numerical methods).

--
- It is suitable for high-level programming where most low-level computations
  are implemented in a compiled language (e.g. `lm()` and `qr()`.)

--
- It is also quite old.

---

## R Is Fast ...

... when most computations are carried out by calls to compiled code. 

```{r}
x <- rnorm(1e4)

bench::mark(
  {
    y <- numeric(length(x))
    for (i in seq_along(x)) {
      y[i] <- 10 * x[i]
    }
    y
  },
  10 * x
)
```

---
## Loops in Disguise

```{r}
bench::mark(
  sapply(x, function(x_i) 10 * x_i),
  10 * x
)
```

--

`apply()` and co. are basically just loops in disguise.


---

## Vectorization

```{r}
count_zeros_vec <- function(x) {
  sum(x == 0)
}
```

--

* `x == 0` checks if each entry of `x` is 0 and returns a vector of logicals.
--

* `sum()` computes and returns the sum of all elements in a vector. Logicals are coerced to integers. 
--

* In this case the vectorized implementation is cohesive and clear.
--

* The vectorized computations are performed by compiled code (C/C++/Fortran), which run faster than pure R code.
--

* Writing vectorized code requires a larger knowledge of R functions.



---
## Development Cycle Sketch

* Is there a good-enough existing implemention for your problem? If yes, then you are done.
--

* If not, implement a solution and test it. Does it
solve your problem sufficiently well? If yes, then you're done.
--

* If not, then profile (next week!), benchmark, and debug (week 5). Then refactor and optimize.
--


### The Root of All Evil

> We *should* forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.
> Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.
> 
> *â€”Donald Knuth*

---

## Example: Density Estimation

```{r kernDens}
kern_dens <- function(x, h, m = 512) {
  rg <- range(x)
  xx <- seq(rg[1] - 3 * h, rg[2] + 3 * h, length.out = m)
  y <- numeric(m)

  for (i in seq_along(xx)) {
    for (j in seq_along(x)) { #<<
      y[i] <- y[i] + exp(-(xx[i] - x[j])^2 / (2 * h^2)) #<<
    } #<<
  }

  y <- y / (sqrt(2 * pi) * h * length(x))

  list(x = xx, y = y)
}
```


---

## Vectorizing Our Density Estimator

```{r kernDens-vec}
kern_dens_vec <- function(x, h, m = 512) {
  rg <- range(x)
  xx <- seq(rg[1] - 3 * h, rg[2] + 3 * h, length.out = m)
  y <- numeric(m)
  const <- (sqrt(2 * pi) * h * length(x))

  for (i in seq_along(xx)) {
    y[i] <- sum(exp(-(xx[i] - x)^2 / (2 * h^2))) / const #<<
  }

  list(x = xx, y = y)
}
```

---

## Benchmarking

```{r kern-bench, cache = TRUE}
kern_bench <- bench::mark(
  kern_dens(phipsi$psi, 0.2),
  kern_dens_vec(phipsi$psi, 0.2)
)

summary(kern_bench)
```

---
## Plot Benchmark Results

```{r kern-bench-autoplot, message=FALSE, fig.height=4.5, fig.width = 9}
plot(kern_bench, type = "violin")
```

---
## Parameterized Benchmarking

```{r kern-bench-grid, cache = TRUE, message = FALSE}
kern_benchmarks <- bench::press(
  n = 2^(6:9),
  m = 2^(5:11),
  {
    bench::mark(
      loop = kern_dens(x[1:n], h = 0.2, m = m),
      vec = kern_dens_vec(x[1:n], h = 0.2, m = m)
    )
  }
)

head(kern_benchmarks, 3)
```

---
## Plotting Results

```{r kern-bench-fig, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=11, fig.height=4.5}
library(tidyverse)
mutate(kern_benchmarks, expression = as.character(expression)) |>
  ggplot(aes(m, median, color = expression)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(n))
```

# Object-Oriented Programming in R

---

## Many Systems

### In Base R

- S3
- S4
- Reference Classes

--

### Through Packages

- [R6](https://cran.r-project.org/package=R6)
- [S7](https://cran.r-project.org/package=S7)

### This Course

We will focus **entirely** on S3.

---

## Example: Integration

The function `integrate()` takes a function as argument and returns the 
value of numerically integrating the function.
--


It is an example of a *functional*. 
--


```{r}
integral <- integrate(sin, 0, 1)
integral
```

The numerical value of the integral 
$$\int_0^1 \sin(x) \mathrm{d}x$$ 
is printed nicely aboveâ€”including an indication of the numerical error. 

---
## Return Values

In fact, `integrate()` returns a list with a *class label*.

```{r}
str(integral)
```
--

Return values that don't fit into one of the basic data structures 
can be returned as a list as above.

---
## The Return Value of `integrate()`

The class label can be extracted directly.

```{r}
class(integral)
```
--

- The printed result of `integrate()` is not the same as the object itself. 
- What you see is the result of the **method** `print.integrate()`.

---
## Printing Objects of Class Integrate 

```{r}
stats:::print.integrate
```

(The `print.integrate()` function is not exported from the stats package. It is in the 
namespace of the stats package, and to access it directly we use `stats:::`.)

---
## Histogram Objects

```{r temp-hist, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 6}
phi_hist <- hist(phipsi$phi, main = NULL)
```

---
## Histogram Objects

```{r}
class(phi_hist)
```

--

```{r}
str(phi_hist)
```

---
## Histogram Objects

```{r}
phi_hist[1:4]
```


---
## Getting Help for Objects

You can find documentation for `plot()` using e.g. 

```{r help-plot, eval = FALSE}
?plot
```

--
However, this will be uninformative on how an object of class histogram is plotted. 
Try instead 

```{r help-plot-histogram, eval = FALSE}
?plot.histogram
```

This will give the documentation for the plot method for objects of class histogram. 


---
## S3 Overview

* S3 classes are standard data structures (typically lists) with *class labels*.
--

* It is an informal system. No checks of object content.
--

* One implements a *generic* function via `UseMethod()`. E.g.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat(deparse(plot))
```

--

* **Methods** for specific classes are implemented as standard R functions 
with the naming convention `f.classname()` for a method for class `classname` of the function `f()`. 
--

* The system is widely used to write methods for the generic functions `print()`, 
`plot()` and `summary()`. 


---
## Constructing a New Class

```{r, echo=FALSE}
count_zeros_vec <- function(x) {
  sum(x == 0)
}
```

Recall the function `count_zeros_vec()` that counts the number of zeros in a vector.
--


If we need this number many times it is beneficial to compute it once and then 
extract it whenever needed. 

--

We first write a *constructor function* that returns a list with a class
label.

```{r}
count_object <- function(x) {
  structure(
    list(
      x = x,
      n = count_zeros_vec(x)
    ),
    class = "count_object"
  )
}
```

---
## A Data Example

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

count_data <- count_object(rpois(10, 2))
count_data
```

---
## The Generic Function

To activate looking up a method for a specific class, one needs to tell R 
that the function `count_zeros()` is a *generic function*. 

```{r}
count_zeros <- function(x) {
  UseMethod("count_zeros")
}
```
--

We can let the default method be the vectorized version.
```{r}
count_zeros.default <- function(x) {
  count_zeros_vec(x)
}
```

--

Then we can implement a class-specific version for the class `count_object`.

```{r}
count_zeros.count_object <- function(x) {
  x[["n"]]
}
```

---

## A Print Method

And we can also implement a print method.

```{r}
print.count_object <- function(x) {
  cat("Values:", x$x, "\nNumber of zeros:", x$n, "\n")
}
```


```{r}
count_data # Invokes print.count_object()
```

```{r}
count_zeros(count_data) # Invokes count_zeros.count_object()
```

---

## Exercise

### Step 1

Create a constructor function called `summarize_vector()` that 
that takes a numeric vector as input and returns an object of class `vector_summary` containing
the mean, median, and standard deviation of the input vector.

```{r include = FALSE}
summarize_vector <- function(x) {
  structure(
    list(
      mean = mean(x),
      median = median(x),
      sd = sd(x)
    ),
    class = "vector_summary"
  )
}
```

### Step 2

Write a `print()` method for the class `vector_summary` that prints the mean, median, and standard deviation in a neatly formatted way.

---

## Getting Help with R

### Google It

Especially good for error messages.

--

### Generative AI

Also great for error messages and debugging

**Caution**: You need to understand the results, 
especially when you ask it to create something for you.

--

### Absalon Discussion Forum

Use the fact that there are twenty other people in the course
with exactly the same problem.
